    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I studied a Degree on Computer Science in the University Politécnica of Madrid and I have been developing software
      during almost 15 years now.

      Although I have tried several kind of profiles in the computing world (both technical and managerial), in different
      areas (databases, microservices, web services, functional/business analysis...), I have almost always been in the backend
      world because of I feel comfortable working between data and resolving logic problems.

      I am used to the teamwork and I have worked in multidisciplinar teams, even international ones. I believe diversity brings
      a high value to the team and I have learnt a lot of these kind of projects.

      For my work life, I am looking for a job where I never stop learning and "don't settle in", with flexible hours,
      occasional remote work and that encourages teamwork and a good work environment.

        the internal communication between our microservices and others external suppliers (Firebase, ElasticSearch, Cloudinary, Pub/Sub...),
        using several methods such as REST services or queue messaging. Currently, we have microservices developed in several programming languages,
        such as Java, Kotlin or Python, with relational databases (MySql), non relational (MongoDB) and graph-oriented (Neo4j). We use CI/CD and try
        to apply an agile work philosophy."
